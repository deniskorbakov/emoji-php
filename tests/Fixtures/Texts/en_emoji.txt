I 😃just returned from the greatest summer vacation! It was so fantastic, I never wanted it to end.
I spent eight days in Paris, France. My best friends, Henry and Steve, went with me.
We had a beautiful hotel 😇 room in the Latin Quarter, and it wasn’t even expensive.
We had a balcony with a wonderful view.
😙
We visited many famous tourist places. My favorite was the Louvre, a well-known museum.
I was always interested in art, so that was a special treat for me.
The museum 🤪🤑🤗 is so huge, you could spend weeks there.
Henry got tired walking around the museum and said “Enough! I need to take a break and rest.”
